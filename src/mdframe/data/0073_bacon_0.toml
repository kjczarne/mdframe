Capture was surprisingly tough, tracking was not possible until
dark-object scanning mode was used. This resulted in more artefacts
captured around the edges of the item which have been removed as much
as possible. Automatic merge failed.
Texture of high quality, so skipping the capture of texture sources
because I've spent way too much time on this item already.
